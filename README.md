# visualiseKdb
Demo displaying live and historical data from kdb with a python/fastapi api and a react frontend.
The main purpose and most valuable part of this repo is to show a worked example of using a python api to serve live kdb data over a websocket

# Setup Instructions
**Begin streaming dummy kdb data**

Start the kdb server

    >> q .\dataGeneration.q -p 5000 -t 100

**Setup the Python Api**

Make a virtual python environment, activate it, install the required modules, and run the api
    
    >> python -m venv venv
    >> ./venv/Scripts/activate
    >> pip install -r requirements.txt
    >> uvicorn main:app --workers 4

**Launch Demo React Frontend**

In the frontend_react folder, run the first line below to install the necessary modules, and the second to launch the site locally

    >> npm install
    >> npm start

# Performance Tests
"performance_test.py" was used to test how many concurrent websockets the python api can handle.
With the volume of test data generated by "dataGeneration.q", performance started to degrade after there were 20 concurrent connections per worker process.
Not all the messages in the queue were being processed. To fail gracefully, only the last message in the queue is procesed, and the earlier messages are deleted.
The workers started to struggle to open new threads when threads per process went above 50.
Different results may be found if the tests are re-ran on different hardware. These tests were done on a relatively old laptop.
